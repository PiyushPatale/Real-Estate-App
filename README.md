# Real-Estate-App
As a team, We created a Real Estate application using Tkinter.
The application featured an intuitive user interface allowing users to browse and search for properties based on various criteria.
We implemented functionalities like property listings, image galleries, and contact forms, providing a comprehensive experience for potential buyers and sellers.
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in building interactive GUIs and handling real estate data efficiently
